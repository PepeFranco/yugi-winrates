## What this is

This is a simple Next.JS webapp to find how balanced are [Yu-gi-oh! Structure decks](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/products/structure_deck.html) against each other.

Structure decks are pre-built decks for the games that follow a certain strategy. I am tracking all matches that I play with one of those decks against another. Records are kept in a MongoDB atlas DB.

## What it aims to do

Answer the questions

- Which structure deck should you pick versus another one for a fair/balanced game
- How structure decks rank among each other
